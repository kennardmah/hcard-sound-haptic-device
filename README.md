# HCARD Sound Haptic Device - Game5ense

Game5ense aims to innovate the field of assistive technology and rehabilitation devices through human-centered design. It focuses on developing a device that processes surround sound audio and provides haptic feedback to aid users with hearing impairments, enhancing their interaction with the environment.

## About The Project

![Device Concept](https://github.com/kennardmah/hcard-sound-haptic-device/blob/main/images/flyer_render.png?raw=true "Device Concept")

This project is a part of the "Human-Centred Design of Assistive and Rehabilitation Devices" initiative. It involves developing a device capable of translating surround sound into haptic feedback, thereby opening new avenues for sensory experience for those with hearing challenges.

### Features

- **Audio Processing**: Advanced algorithms to capture and process audio in real-time.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Innovative haptic response system to convey audio information.
- **User-Centric Design**: Designed with user feedback at every stage to ensure usability and comfort.
- Arduino IDE
- Python 3.x
