# HCARD Sound Haptic Device

The HCARD Sound Haptic Device project aims to innovate in the field of assistive technology and rehabilitation devices through human-centered design. It focuses on developing a device that processes sound to aid users with hearing impairments, enhancing their interaction with the environment.

## About The Project

![Device Concept](Brand Design/flyer_render.png "Device Concept")

This project is a part of the "Human-centred Design of Assistive and Rehabilitation Devices" initiative. It involves creating a device capable of translating sound into haptic feedback, thereby opening new avenues for sensory experience for those with hearing challenges.

### Features

- **Audio Processing**: Advanced algorithms to capture and process sound in real-time.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Innovative haptic response system to convey sound information.
- **User-Centric Design**: Designed with user feedback at every stage to ensure usability and comfort.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
